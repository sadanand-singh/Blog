If you have been following me on this space, you would have known by now, I am very particular about
my computers, its operating systems, looks, softwares etc. Before you start getting any wrong ideas,
my love for [Arch Linux] is still going strong. However, I have moved on to [Gnome 3] as my choice
desktop. This post is an updated version of my [previous post]({{< relref "myarchsetup.md" >}})
with the latest configuration of my machine. I have also update my
GPU to 1080 Ti to be able to run some computer vision models at reasonable speeds. I use this desktop
for some audio processing and some kaggle-level computer vision/deep learning.

In this post, we will do a complete installation of Arch Linux with Gnome 3 as the desktop
environment. Our setup will also involve encryption of the root partition that will be formatted in
[btrfs]. This post is an updated version of my previous posts on
[Arch Linux]({{< relref "myarchsetup.md" >}}).

Base Installation
=================

Before beginning this guide, I would assume that you have a bootable USB of the latest Arch Linux
Installer. If not, please follow the
[Arch wiki guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media).
Once you login into the installer USB, You will be logged in as the root user, and presented with
a **zsh** shell. I will assume you have an __Ethernet__ connection and hence will be connected to
Internet by default. If you have to rely on wifi, please refer to the
[Wireless Network Configuration](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration)
wiki page for the detailed setup. **You must have Internet connection at this stage before
proceeding any further.**

You should boot into _UEFI_ mode if you have a UEFI motherboard and UEFI mode enabled. To verify
that you have booted in UEFI mode, please run:

```bash
efivar -l
```

This should print all set UEFI variables. Please look at the
[Arch Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide) in case you do
not get any list of UEFI variables.

If you have high resolution 4K monitor like me, you will need to run following to increase fonts
to a readable size:

```bash
pacman -Sy
pacman -S terminus-font
setfont ter-132n
```

We are all set to get started with the actual installation process.

Partitioning Hard Drives
-------------------------

First find the hard drive that you will be using as the main/root disk.

```bash
cat /proc/partitions

  OUTPUT eg.
  major minor  #blocks  name

  8        0  268435456 sda
  9        0  268435456 sdb
  19       0  268435456 sdc
  11       0     759808 sr0
  7        0     328616 loop0
```

We will be using `/dev/sda` as the main disk (with `/` & `/home`), `/dev/sdb` as `/data` and `/dev/sdc`
as `/media` .

Because we are creating an encrypted file system it’s a good idea to first overwrite it with
random data. This can be done by filling the disk with zeros. Note that my disk is 240 GB, hence
I have put a count of 250000. After filling the space with zero, we will need to recreate/overwrite
the GPT.

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M count=250000
gdisk /dev/sda
Found invalid MBR and corrupt GPT. What do you want to do? (Using the
GPT MAY permit recovery of GPT data.)
 1 - Use current GPT
 2 - Create blank GPT

# Then press 2 to create a blank GPT and start fresh

ZAP:
press x - to go to extended menu
press z - to zap
press Y - to confirm
press Y - to delete MBR

# It might now kick us out of _gdisk_, so get back into it:
gdisk /dev/sda

Command (? for help): m
Command (? for help): n

Partition number (1-128, default 1):
First sector (34-500118158, default = 2048) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Last sector (2048-500118, default = 500118) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: 512M
Current type is 'Linux filesystem'
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): ef00
Changed type of partition to 'EFI System'

Partition number (2-128, default 2):
First sector (34-500118, default = 16779264) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Last sector (16779264-500118, default = 500118) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Current type is 'Linux filesystem'
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300):
Changed type of partition to 'Linux filesystem'

Command (? for help): p
Press w to write to disk
Press Y to confirm
```

Repeat the above procedure for `/dev/sdb` and `/dev/sdc`, but create
just one partition with all values as default. At the end we will have
three partitions: `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sda2`, `/dev/sdb1` and `/dev/sdc1`.

Setup Disk Encryption
---------------------

Our /boot partition will be on `/dev/sda1`, while the main installation will be on `/dev/sda2`. In
this setup, we will be enabling full encryption on `/dev/sda2` only.

In order to enable disk encryption, we will first create a root luks volume, open it and then
format it.

```bash
# first, we need to prepare the encrypted (outer) volume
cryptsetup --cipher aes-xts-plain64 --hash sha512 --use-random --verify-passphrase luksFormat /dev/sda2

# This will ask you to type YES in all capital letters.
# I really hope I don't have to lecture you on NOT LOSING this
# password, lest all of your data will be forever inaccessible,
# right?

# then, we actually open it as a block device, and format the
# inner volume later
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 root
```

**Automatic Key Login from an USB/SD Card**

If you want to automatically login the encrypted disk password from an externally attached USB or
SD card, you will first need to create a random key file. Then, add this key to the luks container,
so that it can be later used to open the encrypted drive.

```bash
dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=KEYFILE
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda2 KEYFILE
```

{{< emph info >}} Note that the KEYFILE here should be kept on a separate USB drive or
SD card. {{< /emph >}}

The recommended way of using such a disk would be as follows:

```bash
# assuming our USB of interest is /dev/sdd  and can be formatted
#
# Format the drive
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdd bs=1M
# Create partitions using gdisk
#
gdisk /dev/sdd
#
# Follow along to create one partition (/dev/sdd1) of type 0700
#
# format /dev/sdd1
mkfs.fat /dev/sdd1

# mount the newly format disk on /mnt and then copy the KEYFILE
mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt
mv KEYFILE /mnt/KEYFILE
umount /mnt
```

We will be later using this KEYFILE in our boot loader setup.


Format HDDs
-----------

At this point, we have following drives ready to format: `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/mapper/root`,
`/dev/sdb1` and `/dev/sdc1`. I plan to format `/dev/sda1` with [vfat], `/dev/mapper/root` with
[btrfs][btrfs format], `/dev/sdb1` and `/dev/sdc1` with [xfs].

[vfat]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/FAT
[xfs]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XFS
[btrfs format]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Btrfs

```bash
mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1
mkfs.btrfs -L arch /dev/mapper/root
mkfs.xfs -L data /dev/sdb1
mkfs.xfs -L media /dev/sdc1
```

Now, we will create _btrfs_ subvolumes and mount them properly for installation and final setup.

```bash
mount /dev/mapper/root /mnt
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/ROOT
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/home
umount /mnt
```

Now, once the sub-volumes have been created, we will mount them in
appropriate locations with optimal flags.


```bash
SSD_MOUNTS="rw,nodev,noatime,nodiratime,compress=lzo,ssd,discard,space_cache"
HDD_MOUNTS="rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota"
EFI_MOUNTS="rw,noatime,discard,nodev,nosuid,noexec"
mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS,subvol=ROOT /dev/mapper/root /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/home
mkdir -p /mnt/data
mkdir -p /mnt/media
mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS,nosuid,subvol=home /dev/mapper/root /mnt/home
mount -o $HDD_MOUNTS /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data
mount -o $HDD_MOUNTS /dev/sdc1 /mnt/media

mkdir -p /mnt/boot
mount -o $EFI_MOUNTS /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
```

Base System Installation
------------------------

Now, we will do the actually installation of base packages. At this point, we will also
**save the current `/etc/resolv.conf` file for future use!**


```bash
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel btrfs-progs
genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
```

Initial System Setup
--------------------

Edit the `/mnt/ect/fstab` file to add following `/tmp` mounts.

```bash
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid 0 0
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0
```

Finally bind root for installation.

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
pacman -Syy
pacman -Syu
pacman -S sudo vim
vim /etc/locale.gen

...
# en_SG ISO-8859-1
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
# en_US ISO-8859-1
...

locale-gen
echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
ls -l /usr/share/zoneinfo
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Zone/SubZone /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc --utc
sed -i "s/# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL/%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL/" /etc/sudoers
HOSTNAME=euler
echo $HOSTNAME > /etc/hostname
passwd
```

We will also add *hostname* to our `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
vim /etc/hosts
...
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
::1             localhost.localdomain   localhost
127.0.0.1       $HOSTNAME.localdomain   $HOSTNAME
...
```


Now, we need to update the `mkinitcpio.conf` with specific modules needed for encryption and btrfs.

```bash
vi /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
# on the MODULES section, add "vfat aes_x86_64 crc32c-intel"
# (and whatever else you know your hardware needs.)
#
# on the BINARIES section, add "/usr/bin/btrfsck", since it's useful
# to have in case your filesystem has troubles
#
# on the HOOKS section:
#  - add "encrypt" before "filesystems"
#  - remove "fsck" and
#  - add "btrfs" at the end
#
# re-generate your initrd images

mkinitcpio -p linux
```

Boot Manager Setup
------------------

[systemd-boot] is a simple UEFI boot manager which executes configured EFI images. The default
entry is selected by a configured pattern (glob) or an on-screen menu. It is included with the
[systemd] that comes with the kernel. Assuming `/boot` is your boot drive, first run the following
command to get started:

[systemd-boot]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot
[systemd]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd

```bash
bootctl install
```

It will copy the systemd-boot binary to your EFI System Partition
(`/boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi` and `/boot/EFI/Boot/BOOTX64.EFI` -
both of which are identical - on __x64__ systems ) and add `systemd-boot` itself as the default EFI
application (default boot entry) loaded by the EFI Boot Manager.

Finally to configure out boot loader, we will need the UUID of some of our hard drives. These can
be easily done using the `blkid` command.

```bash
blkid /dev/sda2 > /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
blkid /dev/sda2 >> /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
blkid /dev/mapper/root >> /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
blkid /dev/sdd1 >> /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf

# for this example, I'm going to mark them like this:
# /dev/sda2 LABEL="arch"      UUID=33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333
# /dev/mapper/root LABEL="Arch Linux"   UUID=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444
# /dev/sdd1 LABEL="USB"     UUID=0000-0000  # this is the drive where KEYFILE exists
```

Now, make sure that the following two files look as follows, where UUIDs is the value obtained from
above commands.

```bash
vim /boot/loader/loader.conf
...
timeout 3
default arch
...
vim /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
...

title Arch Linux
linux /vmlinuz-linux
initrd /initramfs-linux.img
options ro cryptdevice=UUID=33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333:luks-33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333 root=UUID=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444 rootfstype=btrfs rootflags=subvol=ROOT cryptkey=UUID=0000-0000:vfat:KEYFILE
...
```

Network Setup
-------------

At first we will need to figure out the Ethernet controller on which cable is connected. This can be
achieved by first finding out the kernel module that is being used by the live version on Arch.
Then the module can be used to track the device that is active.

```bash
lspci -v | grep Ethernet
#
# 02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Attansic Technology Corp. L1 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter (rev b0)
#  ...
#  Kernel driver in use: atl1
#  Kernel modules: atl1

dmesg | grep atl1
# ...
# atl1 0000:02:00.0: enp0s25 link is up 100 Mbps full duplex
```

In my case, the name of the device is `enp0s25`. Using this name of the device, we need to
configure, and enable the `systemd-networkd` service. Note that we will using the `resolv.conf`
that we saved from this session. Network configurations are stored as \*.network in
`/etc/systemd/network`. We need to create ours as below. Once the network settings file has been
created we can enable the `networkd` service.

```bash
vim /etc/systemd/network/50-wired.network

...
[Match]
Name=enp0s25

[Network]
DHCP=ipv4

...
systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service
```

Your network should be ready for the first use! We can also sync time automatically using
the `timesyncd` service:

```bash
vim /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf

...
[Time]
NTP=0.arch.pool.ntp.org 1.arch.pool.ntp.org 2.arch.pool.ntp.org 3.arch.pool.ntp.org
FallbackNTP=0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org 0.fr.pool.ntp.org
...
```
[Avahi](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/avahi) is a tool that allows programs to publish and
discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example
you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to print to, files to look at
and people to talk to. We can easily set it up it as follows:

```bash
pacman -S avahi nss-mdns
systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service
```

GUI Installation with nvidia
----------------------------

We will now install the `nvidia` drivers so that our system is ready for any GUI based desktop
installation after the first boot.

```bash
pacman -S xorg-server nvidia nvidia-libgl nvidia-settings mesa
```

To avoid the possibility of forgetting to update your `initramfs` after
an `nvidia` upgrade, you have to use a `pacman hook` like this:

```bash
# if the hooks folder is not present, create one using mkdir
# mkdir -p /etc/pacman.d/hooks
vim /etc/pacman.d/hooks/nvidia.hook

...
[Trigger]
Operation=Install
Operation=Upgrade
Operation=Remove
Type=Package
Target=nvidia

[Action]
Depends=mkinitcpio
When=PostTransaction
Exec=/usr/bin/mkinitcpio -p linux
...

```

Nvidia has a daemon that is to be run at boot. To start the `persistence` daemon at boot, enable
the `nvidia-persistenced.service`.

```bash
systemctl enable nvidia-persistenced.service
systemctl start nvidia-persistenced.service
```

**Enabling Better tty Resolution During Boot**

The kernel compiled in `efifb` module supports high-resolution nvidia console on EFI systems.
This can enabled by enabling the DRM kernel mode setting.

First, we will need to add following to MODULES section of the `mkinitcpio.conf` file:

-  nvidia
-  nvidia_modeset
-  nvidia_uvm
-  nvidia_drm

We will also need to pass the *nvidia-drm.modeset=1* kernel parameter during the boot.

```bash
vim /etc/mkinitcpio.conf

...
MODULES="vfat aes_x86_64 crc32c-intel nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm"
...

vim /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf

...
options ro cryptdevice=UUID=:luks- root=UUID= rootfstype=btrfs rootflags=subvol=ROOT cryptkey=UUID=:vfat:deepmind20170602 nvidia-drm.modeset=1
...

mkinitcpio -p linux
```


First Boot Installations
========================

Now we are ready for the first boot! Run the following command:

```bash
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```
You should get larger fonts with the new terminal now as we are using the nvidia console now.
It should have automatically unlocked your encrypted root disk, since USB with key is attached to
the machine.

After your new system boots, Network should be setup at the start. Check the status of network:

```bash
# Set readable font first!
setfont ter-132n
ping google.com -c 2

#
# PING google.com (10.38.24.84) 56(84) bytes of data.
# 64 bytes from google.com (10.38.24.84): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.022 ms
# 64 bytes from google.com (10.38.24.84): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.023 ms
#
# --- google.com ping statistics ---
# 2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 999ms
# rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.022/0.022/0.023/0.004 ms
#
```
If you do not get any output from ping, please follow the troubleshooting links at Arch Wiki on
[setting up network](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-networkd).

Now enable the automatic syncing of time from the ntp servers.

```bash
timedatectl set-ntp true
timedatectl status

...
      Local time: Tue 2016-09-20 16:40:44 PDT
  Universal time: Tue 2016-09-20 23:40:44 UTC
        RTC time: Tue 2016-09-20 23:40:44
       Time zone: US/Pacific (PDT, -0700)
 Network time on: yes
NTP synchronized: yes
 RTC in local TZ: no
 ...
```

We can also automate the `hostname` setup using the following `systemd` command. Please
replace `$HOSTNAME` with the hostname of your choice.

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname $HOSTNAME
```

Adding New User
---------------

Choose `$USERNAME` per your liking. I chose `ssingh`, so in future commands whenever you see
`ssingh` please replace it with your `$USERNAME`.

```bash
pacman -S zsh
useradd -m -G wheel -s /usr/bin/zsh $USERNAME
chfn --full-name "$FULL_NAME" $USERNAME
passwd $USERNAME
```

Gnome 3 Installation and Setup
-------------------------------

We can now proceed with the installation of Gnome 3. In the process, we will also install some
useful applications and fonts. The process very trivial, install few packages and then enable the
`gdm` service.

```bash
pacman -S ttf-hack ttf-anonymous-pro ttf-dejavu ttf-freefont ttf-liberation
pacman -S gnome gdm guake gnome-tweak-tool
pacman -S screenfetch curl wget dconf-editor dmidecode git meld
pacman -S unace unrar zip unzip sharutils  uudeview  arj cabextract file-roller

systemctl enable gdm.service
```

Choose pacman Mirrors
----------------------

We will now choose fastest merrors for pacman. The `pacman-contrib` package provides a bash
script, `/usr/bin/rankmirrors`, which can be used to rank the mirrors according to their connection
and opening speeds to take advantage of using the fastest local mirror. Finally, we can reboot to
log on to our new gnome system.

```bash
pacman -S pacman-contrib
cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup
#
rankmirrors -n 6 /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.us > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
pacman -Sy
pacman -Syu
#
systemctl reboot
```

Once, we boot into the new system, we should have a basic gnome 3 desktop waiting for you. In the
following section, we will be do installation and modifications to the system that I prefer.

Post Installation Setup
=======================

After rebooting, you should get the gdm login screen. Use your username and password to login.
This should give you a vanilla gnome 3 screen. We will first install few essentials, then modify
our gnome 3 to look something to my linking. In order to proceed, find the `terminal` program
by pressing `alt + s` and searching for terminal.


Setup AUR
---------

[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) is a community-driven repository for Arch users. This allows you
to install many popular packages that are otherwise not available through core repositories.

In order to make all types of installations uniform, I use
[yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) as the preferred tool for installing all packages. It is blazing
fast as it is written in go and used all the flags from regular pacman.

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
cd ../
rm -rf yay
```

From now on, we can use `yay` as a replacement for `pacman`. Additionally, we can now also
install AUR packages.

Web Browsers
------------

My preferred choice of browsers is *google chrome*.

```bash
yay -S google-chrome
```

[Profile-sync-daemon (psd)][psd] is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage browser profile(s)
in `tmpfs` and to periodically sync back to the physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished by
an innovative use of `rsync` to maintain synchronization between a `tmpfs` copy and media-bound
backup of the browser profile(s). These features of [psd] leads to following benefits:

-   Transparent user experience
-   Reduced wear to physical drives, and
-   Speed

[psd]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/profile-sync-daemon

To setup. first install the `profile-sync-daemon` package.

```bash
yay -S profile-sync-daemon
```

Run *psd* the first time which will create a configuration file at
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/psd/psd.conf` which contains all settings.

```bash
psd
# First time running psd so please edit
# /home/$USERNAME/.config/psd/psd.conf to your liking and run again.
```

In the config file change the BROWSERS variables to `google-chrome`. Also, enable the use of
`overlayfs` to improve sync speed and to use a smaller memory footprint. Do this in the
`USE_OVERLAYFS="yes"` variable.
{{< emph info >}}
Note: USE_OVERLAYFS feature requires a Linux kernel version of 3.18.0 or greater
to work.
{{< /emph >}}

In order to use the OVERLAYFS feature, you will also need to give *sudo*
permissions to psd-helper at the end of the sudoers file, as follows
(replace `$USERNAME` accordingly):

```bash
vim /etc/sudoers
...
$USERNAME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/psd-overlay-helper
...

# Verify the working of configuration using the preview mode of psd:
psd p

# Finally we will enable the user systemctly service to enable psd every time we login.
systemctl --user enable psd.service
systemctl --user start psd.service
```

git Setup
---------

Setup git global options as below. You will need to add the following content to `$HOME/.gitconfig`
file.

```bash
[user]
    name = YOUR_NAME
    email = EMAIL_ADDRESS
[color]
    ui = auto
[status]
    showuntrackedfiles = no

ssh Setup
---------

To get started first install the `openssh` package.

```bash
yay -S openssh
```

The ssh server can be started using the `systemd` service. Before starting the service, however, we
want to generate ssh keys and setup the server for login based only on keys.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

# Create a .ssh/config file for rmate usage in sublime text
vim ~/.ssh/config
...
RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698
...

# Create ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file with list of machines that
# are allowed to login to this machine.
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Finally edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# file to disable Password based logins
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
...
PasswordAuthentication no
...
```

Furthermore, before enabling the `sshd` service, please also ensure to copy your keys to all your
relevant other servers and places like [github](https://github.com/). We can now use `systemd` to
start the ssh service.

```bash
systemctl enable sshd.socket
systemctl start sshd.socket
```

zsh Setup
---------

During the user creation, we already installed the `zsh` shell. We have
also activated a basic setup at first login by the user.

In this section, we will be installing my variation of
[zprezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) package to manage
`zsh` configurations.

We will first install the main zprezto, then add my own modification on top of it.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"

# Now, We will add my version of prezto to the same git repo.
cd ~/.zprezto
git remote add personal git@github.com:sadanand-singh/My-Zprezto.git
git pull personal arch
git checkout arch
git merge master

# Now create relevant soft links
setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N);
do
    ln -sf "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
done

zsh
```

And we are all setup for using `zsh`!

Gnome 3 Modifications
----------------------

We will modify gnome 3 by changing theme, icons and fonts. First install additional themes, fonts,
icons etc.

```bash
yay -S ttf-font-awesome adobe-source-code-pro-fonts

# Sardi icons
git clone https://github.com/erikdubois/Sardi-Extra /tmp/Sardi-Extra
find /tmp/Sardi-Extra -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec rm -rf '{}' \;
cp -rf /tmp/Sardi-Extra/* ~/.icons/
# cleaning tmp
[ -d /tmp/Sardi-Extra ] && rm -rf /tmp/Sardi-Extra
[ -d /tmp/sardi ] && rm -rf /tmp/sardi
# if there is no hidden folder then make one
[ -d $HOME"/.icons" ] || mkdir -p $HOME"/.icons"
wget -O /tmp/sardi.tar.gz "https://sourceforge.net/projects/sardi/files/latest/download?source=files"
mkdir /tmp/sardi
tar -zxf /tmp/sardi.tar.gz -C /tmp/sardi
rm /tmp/sardi.tar.gz
cp -rf /tmp/sardi/* ~/.icons/
[ -d /tmp/sardi ] && rm -rf /tmp/sardi

# Surfn
git clone https://github.com/erikdubois/Surfn /tmp/Surfn
find /tmp/Surfn -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec rm -rf '{}' \;
cp -rf /tmp/Surfn/* ~/.icons/
# cleaning tmp
[ -d /tmp/Surfn ] && rm -rf /tmp/Surfn

# arc theme
yay -S arc-gtk-theme

#Plank Themes
rm -rf /tmp/Plank-Themes
git clone https://github.com/erikdubois/Plank-Themes /tmp/Plank-Themes
find /tmp/Plank-Themes -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec rm -rf '{}' \;
# if there is no hidden folder then make one
[ -d $HOME"/.local/share/plank" ] || mkdir -p $HOME"/.local/share/plank"
# if there is no hidden folder then make one
[ -d $HOME"/.local/share/plank/themes" ] || mkdir -p $HOME"/.local/share/plank/themes"
cp -r /tmp/Plank-Themes/* ~/.local/share/plank/themes/
rm -rf /tmp/Plank-Themes

# Breeze cursor
yay -S breeze-snow-cursor-theme
```

Now you can open `gnome-settings` and `tweaks` tools to change themes, icons, cursors etc. to your
linking. If you have a high resolution 4K monitor like mw, you can enable the fractional upscaling
in the tweaks program. See [this link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1029436/enable-fractional-scaling-for-ubuntu-18-04)
for an example.


pcloud vs Dropbox
------------------

Recently, [dropbox removed support for most of relevant file systems on linux][dropbox-news]. I was
already not a fan of their higher prices. It was time to move on to something better.
Then I found, [pcloud]. This service runs quite well on linux (as well as OSX, I really do not care
about anything related to Windows!). pcloud has some interesting features:
 - You can purchase space for lifetime!
 - All the data actually reside on a fuse drive, so you hard disk is not used
 - You can pay to have support for built-in encryption.
 - The public folder gets a link, that you can use to host a static website or static contents of
your webpages.

Additionally, I found some ultra- great deal over the black Friday weekend! To get support for
pcloud in Arch, all you need to do is install it!

```bash
yay -S pcloud-drive
```

Editors
-------

My choice of editor is neovim and sublime text. Please [refer to my previous post]({{< relref "sublimetext.md" >}}) for
details on setting up Sublime Text 3. Following is the setup required to install it:

```bash
# Install editors
yay -S hugo neovim vim
#
# Sublime Text Repository
curl -O https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg
sudo pacman-key --add sublimehq-pub.gpg
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 8A8F901A
rm sublimehq-pub.gpg

echo -e "\n[sublime-text]\nServer = https://download.sublimetext.com/arch/dev/x86_64" | sudo tee -a /etc/pacman.conf

#Now we can install *sublime-text* as:
yay -S sublime-text/sublime-text
```

This brings us to the conclusion of this installation guide. Hope some of you find it useful.
