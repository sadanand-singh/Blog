**UPDATE: Please see [my latest post]({{< relref "arch_gnome3_setup.md" >}}) on installing Arch
linux with Gnome 3 for an upto date version of this guide.**

In my last post on
[Arch Installation Guide]({{< relref "arch.md" >}}) , We
installed the base system and we can now login into our new system as
root using the password that we set.

Now, we will proceed further to install the Plasma 5 desktop.

Add New User
============

Choose `$USERNAME` per your liking. I chose `ssingh`, so in future commands
whenever you see `ssingh` please replace it with your `$USERNAME`.

```bash
useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash $USERNAME
chfn --full-name "$FULL_NAME" $USERNAME
passwd $USERNAME
```

Plasma 5 Desktop
================

Network should be setup at the start. Check the status of network using:

```bash
ping google.com -c 2
$
PING google.com (10.38.24.84) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from google.com (10.38.24.84): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.022 ms
64 bytes from google.com (10.38.24.84): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.023 ms
$
--- google.com ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 999ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.022/0.022/0.023/0.004 ms
$
```

If you do not get this output, please follow the troubleshooting links
at [arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-networkd) on
setting up network.

I will be assuming you have an NVIDIA card for graphics installation.

To setup a graphical desktop, first we need to install some basic X
related packages, and some *essential* packages (including fonts):

```bash
pacman -S xorg-server xorg-server-utils nvidia nvidia-libgl
```

To avoid the possibility of forgetting to update your _initramfs_ after an
_nvidia_ upgrade, you have to use a _pacman_ hook like this:

```bash
vim /etc/pacman.d/hooks/nvidia.hook
$
...
[Trigger]
Operation=Install
Operation=Upgrade
Operation=Remove
Type=Package
Target=nvidia

[Action]
Depends=mkinitcpio
When=PostTransaction
Exec=/usr/bin/mkinitcpio -p linux
...
$
```

Nvidia has a daemon that is to be run at boot. To start the persistence
daemon at boot, enable the `nvidia-persistenced.service`.

```bash
systemctl enable nvidia-persistenced.service
systemctl start nvidia-persistenced.service
```

{{< card primary "**KWIN FLICKERING ISSUE**" >}}

To avoid screen tearing in KDE (KWin), add following:

```bash
vim /etc/profile.d/kwin.sh
$
...
export __GL_YIELD="USLEEP"
...
```

If this does not help please try adding the following instead -

```bash
vim /etc/profile.d/kwin.sh
$
...
export KWIN_TRIPLE_BUFFER=1
...
```

__Do not have both of the above enabled at the same
time. Please look at [Arch
Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA/Troubleshooting) for
additional details.__

Now continue installing remaining important packages for the GUI.

```bash
pacman -S mesa ttf-hack ttf-anonymous-pro
pacman -S tlp tlp-rdw acpi_call bash-completion git meld
pacman -S ttf-dejavu ttf-freefont ttf-liberation
```

Now, we will install the packages related to Plasma 5:

```bash
pacman -S plasma-meta kf5 kdebase kdeutils kde-applications
pacman -S kdegraphics gwenview
```

Now we have to setup a display manager. I chose recommended SDDM for
plasma 5.

```bash
pacman -S sddm sddm-kcm
vim /etc/sddm.conf

...
[Theme]
# Current theme name
Current=breeze

# Cursor theme
CursorTheme=breeze_cursors
...

systemctl enable sddm
```

Also make sure that network manager starts at boot:

```bash
systemctl disable dhcpcd.service
systemctl enable NetworkManager
```

Audio Setup
===========

This is pretty simple. Install following packages and you should be
done:

```bash
pacman -S alsa-utils pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa libcanberra-pulse
pacman -S libcanberra-gstreamer jack2-dbus kmix
pacman -S mpv mplayer
```

Useful Tips
===========

This part is optional and you can choose as per your taste. Sync time
using the `systemd` service:

```bash
vim /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
$
...
[Time]
NTP=0.arch.pool.ntp.org 1.arch.pool.ntp.org 2.arch.pool.ntp.org 3.arch.pool.ntp.org
FallbackNTP=0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org 0.fr.pool.ntp.org
...
$
timedatectl set-ntp true
timedatectl status
$
...
      Local time: Tue 2016-09-20 16:40:44 PDT
  Universal time: Tue 2016-09-20 23:40:44 UTC
        RTC time: Tue 2016-09-20 23:40:44
       Time zone: US/Pacific (PDT, -0700)
 Network time on: yes
NTP synchronized: yes
 RTC in local TZ: no
 ...
$
```

On Plasma 5, It is recommended to enable no-bitmaps to improve the font
rendering:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/70-no-bitmaps.conf
   /etc/fonts/conf.d
   ```

If you use vim as your primary editor, you may find
this [vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) quite useful.

That's It. You are done. Start playing your new beautiful desktop.
