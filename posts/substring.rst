Problem
~~~~~~~

Given an alphanumeric string, find the shortest substring that occurs
exactly once as a (contiguous) substring in it. Overlapping occurrences
are counted as distinct. If there are several candidates of the same
length, you must output all of them in the order of occurrence. The
"*space*" is NOT considered as a valid non-repeating substring.

**Example:**

Consider the following cases:

Case 1: If the given string is ``asdfsasa``, the answer should be
``['d', 'f']``

Case 2: If the given string is ``sadanands``,

the answer should be ``['sa', 'ad', 'da', 'na', 'nd', 'ds']``

Case 3: If the given string is ``wwwwwwww``, the answer should be
``['wwwwwwww']``

My Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is my solution in *Python*.

It is quite brute force. I am not sure about the order of *find()* and
*rfind()* built-in methods in Python. Assuming these are *O(n)*, my
algorithm is in *O(n3)*. Please put your answers in comments below, if
your answer has a better scaling.

The function definition that I use for finding non-empty non-repeating
strings is recurcive.

.. code:: py

    def findNsubString(s,n):
        subS = []
        for index in range(len(s)+1) :
            x = s[index:index+n]
            if s.find(x)==s.rfind(x) :
                subS.append(x)
        if subS :
            return subS
        else :
            return findNsubString(s,n+1)

I call this method as follows to get the desired results:

.. code:: py

    #! /usr/bin/python
    import argparse
    # Parse Command Line Arguements
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("-s", "--string", default = "asdfdfa", help="String Input")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    s = args.string
    # Call Method to find smallest non-repeating sub-string
    ans = findNsubString(s,1)
    print ans

A similar solution can also be written in JAVA or C++. The corresponding
*find()* and *rfind()* methods in JAVA are called *indexOf()* and
*lastIndexOf()*, respectively. In C++, these methods are called same as
in Python.

Please feel free to put your method definition in any programming
language.
